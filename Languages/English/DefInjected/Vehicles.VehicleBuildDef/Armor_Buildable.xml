<VVE_PowerArmor_Blueprint.description>The T-60 power armor was introduced into service by the U.S. Army shortly after the Battle of Anchorage. This version of the power armor looks very similar to the T-45d model from previous games. Turning a valve on the back "opens" the armor, allowing the operator to get inside. Afterwards, the armor closes and is sealed. In addition, the armor's helmet has a built-in display that allows the operator to monitor the state of the power armor, the environment, and their own health. It has a built-in ammunition counter (showing the current and reserve ammunition levels). In the Fallout series, we were also shown that the helmet has a movable facepiece that flips up and reveals the operator's face, which could also be a subsequent modification rather than an original feature.</VVE_PowerArmor_Blueprint.description>
